        <h3>Bacteria-human gene network</h3>
        <p>This module enables users to obtain mRNAs which expression values are significantly correlated with the abundance of a query bacteria in the specific tumor type. The correlation between mRNA expression and bacterial abundance is measured by Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) with Fisherâ€™s z-transformation.</p>
